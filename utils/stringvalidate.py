# The purpose of this file is to provide a fast function that can be used to 
# make sure a string is safe to chat (i.e. won't get automodded or be cause for 
# concern). This is done by checking the string against a list of banned words
# and phrases, and taking the appropriate action if a match is found.

# Example: 1488 --> 1,488
