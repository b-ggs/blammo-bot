# blammo-bot

Major work in progress. The code is extremely messy right now and there are core parts of the bot that have not been pushed to this repo yet. There is also certain pieces of the bot that will *never* be included in the public repo. These are: 
- Trivia database
- Scramble database
- Security features
- Certain config files (an example or default version will be provided if possible)
- User data (points, gamble loss, etc.)
- Logs
- Anything the sickos could abuse

Again, the code is extremely messy right now and if you roast me, then L nerd get rekt ur a bigger nerd than i am ICANT


## To-Do Items

- Add example trivia and scramble datasets so people know how to interact with them correctly
- Add documentation for all current functions
- Fix the latin-1 vs. UTF-8 encoding issue with the trivia database
- Auto trivia/scramble validation and format checking
- Refactor original twitch bot framework to allow class self variable to be used (so we can stop using global all the time)
- make timestamps system more comprehensive and robust
- general: integrate custom functions with original framework better
- general: remove or disable unused functionality from original bot framework
