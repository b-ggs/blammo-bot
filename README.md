# blammo-bot

Major work in progress. The code is extremely messy right now and there are core parts of the bot that have not been pushed to this repo yet. There is also certain pieces of the bot that will *never* be included in the public repo. These are: 
- Trivia database
- Scramble database
- Security features
- Certain config files (an example or default version will be provided if possible)
- User data (points, gamble loss, etc.)
- Logs
- Anything the sickos could abuse

Again, the code is extremely messy right now and if you roast me, then L nerd get rekt ur a bigger nerd than i am ICANT
